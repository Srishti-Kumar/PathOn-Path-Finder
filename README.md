# PathOn 
The goal of the project was to develop a Web Application that tells us the best route to reach the destination from starting position with considering WAYPOINTS as its main feature.
This application locates waypoints and while considering them it will tell the best route to visit all waypoints to finally the destination and it also tells step-by-step street ways to the user.
